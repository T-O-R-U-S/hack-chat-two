# Hack Chat Two üñ•Ô∏è
The first HackChat (discontinued) has an awful codebase which makes me and YOU feel awful so I have decided to redo it with Svelte and Channels!

###### <sub>Hint: Serverless + realtime is not a good combo</sub>

## Future plans?
- Account system (Ground work had been laid out before but I'd undone it due to a fatal bug related to cookies, combined with my inability to implement protection against cross-site request forgery (A.K.A account/cookie theft resulting in a 'forged' cookie that can be used to maliciously make requests))
- Currency, now that I know how to make a back-end database smh
